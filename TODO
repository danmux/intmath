TODO: 

- Decide how to deal with overflow. 
  One possible option: make result equal to results of standard math package. 
  This might get strange results though, see: http://play.golang.org/p/Bs2ioK8Rid

- Decide which functions should be implemented (for example, do Sin and Cos make 
  sense in a non-FPM integer context?)
